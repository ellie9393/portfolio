## How to use: üöÄ

This is a single-page (index.html) website. Users can scroll or click on each section on the navbar, and it jumps to the proper section.

## How my website is built: üõ†Ô∏è

1. My website is built by using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.
2. For the Navbar Icons I used Bootstrap icons.
3. For the animation I used TimelineMax library using JavaScript.
   I watched this video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmoccuRiN4
4. For the experience section, I used cards class for the layout.
5. For the contact form I used jQuery to validate user inputs and called ‚ÄúisEmail‚Äù method to verify is a valid email address. It would show a message when it‚Äôs not a valid address. Also, it shows a message when there is no error. I didn‚Äôt make a backend to save user inputs or send an email to me.

## Run the webpage

To run the webpage, simply download the project and run the index.html file.
